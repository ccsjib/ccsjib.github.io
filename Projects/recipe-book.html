        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat oven to 425°F. Place 1 pie crust in ungreased 9-inch glass pie plate. Press firmly against side and bottom.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie plate. Top with second crust. Wrap excess top crust under bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal; flute. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust.</p> 
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>
Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch wide strips of foil after first 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving.</p>

            <li>The flour tossed with the fresh apples turns their juices into a thickened, spiced sauce during baking. Mix it with the sugar and spices before tossing the mixture with the apples.</li>
            <li>Two (21-oz.) cans of more fruit apple pie filling can be used if you’re short on time.</li>
            <li>Let your apple pie cool for at least 2 hours before cutting into it. The filling will thicken as it cools, making it easier to slice.</li>
            <li>To make Caramel-Pecan Apple Pie: right after removing the pie from the oven, drizzle with 1/3 cup caramel ice cream topping. Sprinkle with 2 to 4 tablespoons chopped pecans.</li>
            <li>To freeze Baked Pie: Assemble and bake pie as directed in recipe. Cool completely. Wrap pie tightly with plastic wrap. Place pie in a 2-gallon freezer storage bag; seal. Freeze up to 4 months. To reheat, thaw pie in refrigerator overnight. Remove bag and plastic wrap. Cover with foil, bake at 350°F for 25 to 30 minutes or until warm.</li>

        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.</p> 
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When ready to assemble sandwich cookies, remove and uncover remaining cookie dough from refrigerator; let stand at room temperature 10 minutes to soften. For each sandwich cookie, spread 2 tablespoons softened cookie dough on bottom of 1 baked cookie. Top with second cookie, bottom side down; gently press together. Repeat with remaining baked cookies and softened cookie dough. Serve immediately, or refrigerate up to 8 hours. </p>
