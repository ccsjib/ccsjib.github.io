        <h1>SIM Swapping!</h1>

      <h2>What is it?!</h2>
      
        
        <h3>SIM Swapping is when an attacker changes the <strong>SIM card</strong> that your phone number is attached to. This bypasses 2FA because the attacker now has locked you out of your own phone number including calls and text messages.</h3>
        <p>This is an interesting cyber threat because instead of hacking using technical methods, in many cases the attacker manipulates customer service representatives into allowing them access into the victim's account. They can do this by impersonating the customer using any details they have, and when the rep asks for the PIN this is when they attempt to make the rep feel bad and allow them into the account. </p>
        <p>The attacker may tell the rep various stories to explain the situation. For example, they may say that they lost “their” phone or had it stolen. </p>
        <p>T-Mobile was more susceptible to these attacks until about 6 months ago. This was because until recently they did not make use of 2FA methods like sending a Number Transfer PIN to customer online accounts. Competitors like AT&T and Verizon have already been doing this.</p>
        <p>SIM swapping allowed hackers to gain over 68 million dollars last year!</p>

        <ul>
          <li>On one side some would say to move away from phone number based authentication to an authenticator app</li>
          <li>On the other hand, it is cellular carriers that should have the security measures in place to stop someone from impersonating you and stealing your phone number! </li>
          <li>Example: T-Mobile was very vulnerable to this, and one of the features they added was a SIM swap lockout that required a call to customer service to swap SIMs. The issue with this is social engineering works on the employees. </li>
          
        I think this is an outrageous lack of security on cellular carriers. They should have the proper training and identification methods in place to make sure no one can impersonate a customer to steal their second method of identification. I am happy that carriers like T-Mobile have updated their systems to increase security measures with their own form of 2FA, but this is still somewhat problematic for people who do not use carrier web services. 
        Not only does it give the attacker access to your phone number but also takes away your access so you cannot change your password or deactivate 2FA in time. It catches the customer by surprise and there is nothing that can be done about it. 
        Voice identification would be great, but that may be unreliable, costly, and may be a breach of privacy. This is a fine line that must be worked around.
